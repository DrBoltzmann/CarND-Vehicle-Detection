    "\n",
    "The solution process includes the following logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to perform feature extraction on a labeled training set of images.\n",
    "* Train a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on the training data.\n",
    "* Apply color transforms and append binned color features, color histograms, etc. to the HOG feature vector to improve performance. \n",
    "* Data is normalized, then randomized selections for training and testing data are defined.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected."
